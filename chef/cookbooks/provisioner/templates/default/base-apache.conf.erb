# Strictly, Listen and NameVirtualHost should be set by modifying the
# [:apache][:listen_ports] attribute in the setup_base_images recipe, but that
# would somehow require rewriting ports.conf (listen.conf on SUSE), so we'd
# need to either set that attribute *before* including the apache2 recipe
# (in which case the provisioner port will be the *only* port apache listens
# on, preventing using apache for any other purpose), or we need to rewrite
# ports.conf to include whatever's already there *plus* the provisioner
# port.  The latter is the best behaved, but frankly strikes me as messy.
# So until I come up with something better, here we go:
Listen <%=@port%>
NameVirtualHost *:<%=@port%>

<VirtualHost *:<%=@port%>>

    DocumentRoot <%= @docroot %>
    ErrorLog <%= @errorlog %>
    CustomLog <%= @logfile %> combined
