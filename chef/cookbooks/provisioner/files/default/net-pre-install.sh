# This script is called by the net_ubuntu.seed file during
# ubuntu install.  It handles doing the manual sets needed to layout the
# filesystem the rest of the way before running the common_install.sh.
#
# The intent is that once the system is finished installing, the customer
# will edit the config.json file and run install.sh to complete installation
# and initial configuration.

#
# We are a net install.
